## üöÄ Live Portfolio: [https://osdaolfonabaco-beep.github.io](https://osdaolfonabaco-beep.github.io)

This repository contains the source code for my professional portfolio website. This site serves as the central hub for my professional identity as an **AI & Cybersecurity Specialist**, built to showcase my enterprise-grade projects, technical capabilities, and professional CV to potential employers and collaborators.

## üéØ About This Project

This portfolio is the "front door" to my body of work. It is built from scratch with clean, responsive, and semantic HTML & CSS, and hosted on GitHub Pages. The primary goal is to provide a clear, high-impact overview of my skills at the intersection of Cloud Engineering, AI, and Cybersecurity.

### üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack (Portfolio)

* **`HTML5`**: Semantic markup, structured for accessibility and ATS-friendliness.
* **`CSS3`**: Custom properties, Flexbox, and Grid for a clean, modern, and responsive layout.
* **`JavaScript`**: Used minimally for future interactivity (e.g., mobile menu).
* **`GitHub Pages`**: Deployed and hosted directly from this repository.

## üìÇ Featured Projects (Showcased on Site)

This portfolio highlights four key projects that demonstrate my ability to solve complex, expensive business problems.

1.  **"Superhuman" AI Security Gateway**
    * A production-grade, containerized (FastAPI/Docker) security proxy to protect enterprise LLMs from Prompt Injection attacks and PII data leakage (DLP).

2.  **Autonomous SOC Analyst Agent**
    * An AI agent that fully automates the Level 1 SOC Analyst workflow: ingesting AWS logs, detecting anomalies, enriching data via threat intel APIs, and generating incident reports with LangChain.

3.  **AWS Serverless Log Analyzer**
    * A 100% serverless security analysis pipeline deployed via **Terraform (IaC)**. Uses S3 events to trigger a Docker-based Lambda function for real-time log analysis.

4.  **LogSentinel Cloud Security Data Pipeline**
    * An end-to-end data engineering pipeline that ingests logs from AWS S3, enriches them against threat APIs, and persists the findings in an SQL database for historical analysis.

## üìÑ Professional CV (Included)

This repository also contains the source code (`cv.html`, `cv-style.css`) for my professional CV. This HTML/CSS version was built to be 100% clean, ATS-compliant, and free of watermarks, and is downloadable from the main portfolio site.

* **[View the Live CV HTML](https://osdaolfonabaco-beep.github.io/cv.html)**
